    <p>Once there lived a farmer in a village. He had a wonderful goose. It laid a golden egg every day. He used to sell the egg in the market. He became rich. But in course of time he became very greedy. He thought that the stomach of the goose was full of eggs. Actually, the farmer was very greedy and impatient. One day he thought that if he cut the belly of the goose, he would get all the eggs at a time and by this way he would be rich overnight. If he could get all the eggs at a time, he would be a rich man overnight. If he could get the eggs at a time, he would be a rich man quickly. In order to satisfied his greed, he cut the belly of the goose open. But alas! There was no egg inside it. He was so sorry and started crying. He became extremely disappointed and lost the valuable goose forever.</p>
